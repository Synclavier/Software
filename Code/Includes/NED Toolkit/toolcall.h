/*	NED Toolkit - General Purpose Callout Mechanism		Copyright © 1990 by New England Digital Corp.  All rights reserved.		This library implements a general-purpose callout mechanism.  A callout	can be created with callfor() by providing a Handler and a pointer to	be passed as a parameter to that handler when the callout is made.		Callouts are queued across applications (or across DRVR/application)	with callnq() and are served by the application with callq().		A call queue is global to an application. The process Manager is used to	wakeup the application on queueing.		Modification History:		03/25/92	mac		added process manager calls		10/31/90	MAC		rewired for call queueing		09/13/90	MAC		added support for DRVR		07/25/90	MAC		Created this file*/#ifndef NED__TOOLCALL#define NED__TOOLCALL#include	"callstructs.h"#ifdef __cplusplusextern "C" {#endifvoid	callqueue_open(void);				/* init process's queue */void	callqueue_close(void);				/* destroy queue */callout	callfor(void *that, Handler *out);	/* install callout */int		calls(void);						/* test call queue */void	callq(void);						/* serve call queue */void	callon(callout *c);					/* invoke a call */#ifdef __cplusplus}#endif#endif	/* NED__TOOLCALL */
