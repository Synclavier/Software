/* Scsi Command Routines *//* These routines are used to issue various commonly used SCSI   commands to devices on the SCSI bus. All routines that use   a buffer assume the data is in XPL string format, with word 0   storing the number of bytes and all data accessed as bytes, not words.   DataIn: proc(Buffer);      Transfers bytes of data from the SCSI bus into the buffer provided      until the bus phase changes from DATA IN phase.   DataOut: proc(Buffer);      Transfers bytes of data from the buffer provided to the SCSI bus      until the bus phase changes from DATA OUT phase.         RequestSense: proc(DevAdr,Length,Buffer) returns (fixed);      Issues the REQUEST SENSE SCSI command to the device specified,      asking for LENGTH bytes of sense information. The SCSI Sense Key      is returned.   GetStatus: proc(DevAdr) returns (fixed);      Reads the status byte and command complete message for the device      specified. If Check Condition status is found, RequestSense is      called to determine the problem. The SCSI Sense Key is returned.   TestUnitReady: proc(DevAdr) returns (fixed);      Issues the TEST UNIT READY SCSI command to the device specified.      The SCSI Sense Key is returned.   Inquiry: proc(DevAdr,Length,Buffer) returns (fixed);      Issues the INQUIRY SCSI command to the device specified, asking      for LENGTH bytes of inquiry information. The SCSI Sense Key is      returned.   ModeSelect: proc(DevAdr,Page,Length,Buffer) returns (fixed);      Issues the MODE SELECT SCSI command to the device specified, asking      for LENGTH bytes of mode information to be sent to the page specified.      The SCSI Sense Key is returned.   ModeSense: proc(DevAdr,Page,Length,Buffer) returns (fixed);      Issues the MODE SENSE SCSI command to the device specified, asking      for LENGTH bytes of mode information from the page specified. The      SCSI Sense Key is returned.   ReadCapacity: proc(DevAdr,Buffer) returns (fixed);      Issues the READ CAPACITY SCSI command to the device specified, asking      for the 8 bytes of capacity information. The SCSI Sense Key is      returned.   DriveTemp: proc(DevAdr,Buffer) returns (fixed);      This is a special command that is used to get the internal operating      temperature of the Maxoptix Tahiti series of optical drives.  The       SCSI Sense Key is returned.*/extern	fixed	inquiry(fixed, fixed, fixed[]);							// get inquiry dataextern	fixed	modeselect(fixed, fixed, fixed, fixed[]);				// Send Mode Sense Dataextern	fixed	modesense(fixed, fixed, fixed, fixed[]);				// Get Mode Sense Dataextern	fixed	drivetemp(fixed, fixed[]);								// get temperature informationextern	fixed	preventallow(fixed, fixed);								// get temperature informationextern	fixed	issueformat(fixed);										// issue format/* for later use: *//*	dcl Reserve    proc(fixed,fixed,array) returns (fixed) external; 	*//* reserve scsi device *//*	dcl Release    proc(fixed) returns (fixed) external; 				*//* release scsi device */
