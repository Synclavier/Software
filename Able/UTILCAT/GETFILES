/* The following routines search for wildcarded files:      START_SEARCH (Filenames, Climb, Level):        Initializes the search to search for FILENAMES in the catalog        specified by LEVEL.  FILENAMES is a string containing the desired        filenames to search for separated by spaces.  Wildcards in        filenames are fully supported.  If CLIMB is TRUE, all subcatalogs        on LEVEL are also searched.      GETFNAME (Filename):        Returns the next FILENAME found from the original list of FILENAMES        (specified in START_SEARCH).  A boolean TRUE is returned if a name        was found.  WILDCARD is also returned and is TRUE if the matched        name was the result of a wildcard match.  The FILENAME returned is        the complete treename of the file (starting from LEVEL).*/library ':utilcat:libs:getfiles';dcl treemax lit '132'; /* max no. characters in treename */dcl start_search proc(fixed array, boolean, fixed) external; /* setup to start search */dcl getfname     proc(fixed array) returns(boolean) external; /* get next treename */dcl treename fixed array external; /* current treename */dcl wildcard boolean external; /* indicates wildcard characters in matched name */
