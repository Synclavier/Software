/* This module handles text pattern matching.   It searches for. a string pattern in the line and finds the pattern if there is a match.. Note: The file :-XPL:ASCIILIT must be inserted by your program . before inserting this module...  Prescan (String):      Executes a preliminary scan for wild cards in a string..                         If the procedure encounters an escape delimiter,.                         '/', it erases it from the string and ignores the.                         character.  If it finds a '?' or a '*' that is.                         not proceeded by an escape delimiter, it substitutes an internal.                         representation that is used by Search or Index..                         PRESCAN returns TRUE if a wildcard was scanned...  Search (Line, String): Searches for a pattern in a line.  If the procedure .                         finds a pattern, it returns the line position where the match first occurs..                         Otherwise, it returns a value of -1...  Index (Line, String, Line_Pos):  This procedure searches for a pattern.                                   in a line given an index or a starting.                                   position in that line. If the procedure .                                   finds the pattern, it returns the line position.                                   where the match first occurs.  Otherwise it returns a -1 value. ..*/Library ':utilcat:libs:searchit';Dcl Eschr  Lit 'a.slash'; /* Character used to force the next character to be taken literally */Dcl Single Lit 'a.question'; /* Character used to represent any character */Dcl Group  Lit 'a.star'; /* Character used to represent zero or more characters */Dcl Prescan Procedure (Fixed Array) Returns (Boolean) External;Dcl Search  Procedure (Fixed Array, Fixed Array) returns (Fixed) External;/*Dcl Index   Procedure (Fixed Array, Fixed Array, Fixed) returns (Fixed) External;*/Dcl Match_Length Fixed External; /* The length of the pattern match */Dcl Match_Count  Fixed External; /* The count of matches performed */
