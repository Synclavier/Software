/* Modification History:     12/01/85  revised for -6 configuration [KJC]     09/11/86  revised for -7 catalog structure [KJO]*//* Things to do:     1) Implement LIM and LRE (long immediate and long relative) operators.     2) If RE or LRE is used, the assembler should make sure it's a        relative transfer.  Likewise, if IM or LIM is used, the assembler        should make sure it's an absolute transfer.  The latter should        be no stronger than a warning as many old programs use IM(label-.-1)        rather than RE since RE was not around then.     3) Implement relocatable assemblies.  See notes in XPL folder.*/dcl rel.date data ('N.E.D.
