-XPL contains definitions for libraries written in XPL.The files in -XPL as of 23 July 1987 are:LIBS - a subcatalog containing all the librariesTIMER - a subcatalog containing performance monitoring software (for Model B processor only!)LITERALS - useful literals (cannot be used with ASCIIDEF)ASCIILIT - ASCII character set definitionsASCIIDEF - ASCII character set definitions and other useful literals (obsolete)SYSLITS - operating system literals (requires MEM.SIZ to be defined - CATRTNS defines MEM.SIZ)SCSILITS - SCSI subsystem literalsTAPELITS - tape drive subsystem literalsOPTLITS - optical disk literalsWHENDISK - generic WHEN DISKERROR handlerTTYIO - primitive terminal handling without interruptsTERMUT - advanced terminal handling without interruptsTTYIOI - primitive terminal handling with interruptsTERMUTIL - advanced terminal handling with interruptsPLOTLIB - plotting package (requires use of TERMUT or TERMUTIL)CATRTNS - system catalog routines (no swapping)CATSWAP - system catalog routines (swapping)DEVUTIL - device utilitiesCATUTIL - catalog utilities (requires use of TERMUT or TERMUTIL)FILEIO - buffered file I/O a la C (no swapping)FILESWAP - buffered file I/O a la C (swapping)STRINGS - string processing routines a la CSCANARGS - scan command line argumentsDYNAMIC - dynamic memory allocation (heap management)SCSI - SCSI device drivers (doesn't support EXTREAD, EXTWRITE, POLYREAD, or POLYWRITE)SCSISWAP - swapping SCSI device driversSCSICMDS - high level SCSI commands (swapping only)OPTICAL - optical disk driversTAPEFACE - primitive cartridge tape drive interface routinesTAPELIB - advanced cartridge tape drive interface routinesTAPESCSI - advanced SCSI tape drive interface routinesTAPEBRDG - bridge between SCSI tape and cartridge tape; includes READDATA/WRITEDATA supportTERMROUT - definitions of advanced terminal utilities (interrupt independent insert)CATROUT - definitions of catalog routines (swap independent)SCSIROUT - definitions of SCSI routines (swap independent)FILEROUT - definitions of buffered file I/O routines (swap independent)CMDROUT - definitions of SCSI command routines (swap independent)OPTROUT - definitions of optical disk drivers (swap independent)
