.ce          ~DOCUMENTATION ON RELEASE N SOUND EDITOR FEATURES~.nfSome new commands have been added to the MODIFY menu of theSample-To-Memory Sound Editor.  They are as follows:.it {\MixThis command is used to mix two sound files together.  The samplesof the named sound file at the adjusted volume level are addedto the current sound file samples.  The mark starts of each sound fileare lined up.To use this command, type in the name of the sound fileto mix with the current sound file as well asthe volume level by which to adjust it.The specified volume level of the sound file to be mixed with the currentsound file may range between 0.000 and 30.000.  To magnify the soundfile to be mixed with the current sound file, enter a number larger than one.To diminish the sound file to be mixed with the current sound file,enter a number less than one.  The default adjust value is oneif a volume level is not specified.  Noise occurs if the volume level of the mixed sound files exceed five volts.\InvertThis command is used to invert the phase of a sound file.  Althoughthere is a visual difference in the wave shape, there is not an audibledifference.  This command is useful, however, if you want to subtract samples from two mixed sound files.\DC TrimThis command finds the average DC offset in a sound file and removes it.  It determines the average signal level andsubtracts it from the sound file so that the sound file is centeredaround zero.It is a useful feature because it maximizes the volume level by whichthe sound file may be adjusted..it }
