.ce          ~DOCUMENTATION ON RELEASE N SOUND EDITOR FEATURES~.nfSome new commands have been added to the DISPLAY menu of theSample-To-Memory Sound Editor.  They are as follows:.it {\LockLocks the current sound file display in the bottom window of theSound Editor screen.  If the current sound file appeared in stereo,the right channel display is erased and the left channel of theof the current sound file is drawn in the bottom window.The advantage of the Lock command is that the user can comparetwo different sound files at one time, as long as the two soundfiles have compatible sampling rates.  It is used as a visualaid so that the user may edit one sound file while comparing itto another sound in the bottom display window.To lock a sound file, select the display feature by pressingthe appropriate key on the terminal keyboard or select the feature using the mouse.The display will then be updated in the bottom window.To compare the locked sound file with another sound file,recall a sound file with a compatible sampling rate using the Sound Editor recall feature.Once a sound file is recalled, the Sound Editor screen will thendisplay the sound file just recalled in the top display window and the locked sound file in the bottom display window.Editing will only effect the current sound file displayed in the topleft channel window.\UnlockUnlocks the locked sound file and erases the bottom display window.If the current sound file is in stereo, the right channel ofthe stereo sound file is displayed.Unlock is used if the user no longer wants to compare two sound filesor wants to examine the right channel of the current stereo sound fileand a locked sound file is displayed.If the user wants to lock the current sound file and another soundfile has been locked, the locked sound file must be unlocked before the current one is locked.If a sound file is locked and the user exits the Sound Editor,that sound file is automatically unlocked..it }.bpSome new commands that have been added to the MODIFY menu in Sample-to-Memory Sound Editor are as follows:.it {\NormalizeFinds the maximum Signal-to-Noise ratio in the sound fileand adjusts the level of all of the samples in order toachieve the maximum Signal-to-Noise ratio.It is a useful command because it standardizes the sound filevolume to achieve the maximum signal-to-noise ratio without clippingthe volume level.To use the Normalize feature, type the key on the terminal keyboardor select the feature using the mouse.\Reverse LoopThis feature is a variation of the Loop command because not onlydoes it sustain sound files indefinitely and crossfade the slices of sound, but it also extends the looping region by appending thereverse of the looping region to the looping region. It is a featurethat may be used for hard to loop sound files, such as string sound files.The total loop length of the sound file includes the beginning portionof the sound file, twice the looping region, minus a crossfade length.A crossfade length is lost when the looping region is reversed, appended,and crossfaded with itself.The crossfading smooths out the looping.  When the sound file approaches theend time of the loop length, the samples preceeding the begin timeof the loop are crossfaded with those samples preceeding the end loop time.The samples of the looping region are also crossfaded with the reverseof the appended looping region.To reverse loop a sound file, determine the begin and end timesof the loop as well as the crossfade time.  If a crossfade timeis not specified the default crossfade time of .500 000 seconds will beused.The begin and end times can be entered in seconds or by typing a symbol which represents a valid sample time.The mouse may also be used to enter the loop times.The specified crossfade time should be less than the period between the mark start point and the loop begin time and less than the timebetween the begin and end loop times.  If the crossfade time isnot less than either of these times, the longest time availablewill be used as a crossfade time..it }
