.*  SMGRDOC - Top level of the Screen Manager Documentation.*.*  Modified:.*  12/24/87 - MWH - Changed "mod" to "dcl" in demo program only.*  12/04/87 - MWH - Minor fixes; new field editing commands, index.*  11/09/87 - MWH - Minor fixes.*  11/02/87 - MWH - Add Cameron's new routines; other minor fixes.*  10/08/87 - MWH - Add index of procedure names.*  10/07/87 - MWH - Combine and update earlier documents.*.*.*  Warning!  If you change the text significantly, the index will.*  become obsolete!  To create a new index, do the following:.*     - Each time you run HFORM, a new -INDEX is created.*     - Determine if it has changed by making a copy of -INDEX.*       as "X" and then type "SORT" giving "X" as filename.  Compare.*       "X" with INDEX.S.  If different, you need a new index; continue..*     - Copy "X" to be the current INDEX.S.*     - Make a copy called INDEX.T and run SED on it.  Make all lines.*       35 characters long or less.  eg:  "TOO.LONG.NAME.HERE,  50".*       becomes "TOO.LONG.NAME..*          HERE,  50"  (<CR> and indent 3 spaces to break up lines).*     - Unsave the previous INDEX.C and run COLUMN specifying.*       input file INDEX.T and output file INDEX.C.  Use 50 lines.*       per page..*     - Now replace in the file "INDEX" from below the .nfill with.*       the contents of INDEX.C.  Replace the two blank lines (meant.*       to show page breaks) with a single line ".bpage"..*     - When you re-run HFORM, the index is now correct..*.*.sp 17.bx {.ce 100.sp 2S C R E E N   M A N A G E RP R O G R A M M E R ' S   G U I D E.sp 2.ce 0.bx }.sp 17.ce(c) New England Digital Corporation.sp.ce04-Dec-1987.sp 5.ce 2The information contained in this manual is for internal use only.~DO NOT~ send this out to offices or customers!.bp 5.fo '1) INTRODUCTION'-#-'SCREEN MANAGER.do SEC1.do SEC2.do SEC3.do SEC4.do SEC5.do SEC6.do SEC7.do SEC8.do INDEX.bp 2.fo 'TABLE OF CONTENTS'-#-'SCREEN MANAGER.tc
