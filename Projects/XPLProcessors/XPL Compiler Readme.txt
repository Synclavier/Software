XPL Compiler and XPL Translater

See ReadMe XCode Setup.txt for defining SYNCLAVIER_BUILD and SYNCLAVIER_TEMP source trees.

The XPL Compiler XCode project contains two targets, one for the XPL Compiler and one for the XPL Translator.

To use the XPL Compiler with the AbleSoureceBrowser project to build the real time software
the XPLCompiler executable needs to be moved to /usr/local/bin. The scripts that build the real
time software expect the compiler executable to be there.
