Able Disk Tool

See ReadMe XCode Setup.txt for defining SYNCLAVIER_BUILD and SYNCLAVIER_TEMP source trees.

AbleDiskTool is ancient software. It makes heavy use of the deprected FSSpec file spec.
That means it can only be built as a 32-bit application.

FSRefs are now deprecated as well; a modern rewrite would have to migrate to NSUrl*.
